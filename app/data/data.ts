I love to play with javascript and that is the reason why I like Front-End. Having skill on Back-End (such as Php, Laravel & Mysql DB) made my skill level up as a Front-End developer to gather sound knowledge about API and handling data from server , team work with Back-End team as well. I am so pleased as your eyes focused on my portfolio.'
